3) using fdqn[fully qulafied domain name]   ---> #ssh <username>@<fqdn>
					      ex:#ssh root@serverb.lab.exmaple.com


---> there is a config file /etc/ssh/sshd_config using this config u can restrict root login.

--> public key of remote machines will be copied to /~/.ssh/known_hosts file.


passwordless login:-
*******************
-> whenever the user wants to make a passwordless login then the public key has to be copied to remote machine.

#ssh-keygen   --> to generate a public 	& private key 

id_rsa.pub  --> this is public key
id_rsa  ---> this is private key.

--> passphrase  -> there is a chance to give another password or you can skip the password.

#ssh-copy-id   <username>@<ip address> 
ex: #ssh-copy-id root@192.168.142.140
note:-
******
-> it will ask password for one time after entering the password for one time then u will have a password less login to that perticular machine.

#ssh root@192.168.142.140     ---> to verify passwordless login.
