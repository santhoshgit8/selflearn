package management:-
*******************
package:-
********
it is a collection of software files used to install a application or product.

package manager:-
****************
it is the utility to manage the package like install,uninstalling & updating packages.

-> we have package utilities.

1) RPM (redhat package manager)
2) YUM 	(yellow dog update manager)


1)RPM:-
*******
-> it is a default package manager in redhat os.

-> in rpm we can just install the packages which have .rpm extension

-> rpm is insatlled in /var/lib/rpm directory.

-> rpm log files are stored in /var/log/yum.log file.


understanding pkg naming architecture:-
**************************************

<package name>		<version>	<release>	<architecture>	.rpm (extension)

nfs-utils		-2.4.6		-8.el8		.x86_64		.rpm


note:-
*****
rpm is internally classsified into 3 components:

1) files installed by rpm.

2) info about a package metadata.(name,version,release,architecture)

3) scripts may run while the package is installed,uninstalled,updated.



command of rpm:-
*****************


#rpm -ivh  <package name with .rpm extension>

-i -> install
-v -> verbose
-h -> hash prompt

ex: #rpm -ivh 

#rpm -q <package name> 

-q -> query package

#rpm -qa 

-qa  --> to lista all packages installed.

#rpm -qa | wc -l  ---> to list number of packages installed.

#rpm -e <package name> 

-e -> uninstalling pkg

#rpm -qi <package name> 

-i -> info about pkg

#rpm -qc <pkg name> 

-c --> configuration files


#rpm -ql <pkg name> 

-l -> list pkg related files.

#rpm -U <pkg name> 

-U -> updating the pkg

#rpm -ivh <pkg name>  --nodeps

ex: #rpm -ivh zip-3.0-23.el8.x86_64.rpm  --nodeps


2)yum:-
*******
-> this is also a default pkg managing utility in linux.

-> it is used to install,update & remove the pkgs.

-> yum uses repository to manage rpm files.

-> a repository is a collection of rpm files.

-> repositories can be configured either local or using ftp/http.

-> yum also installs all the dependencies required but rpm does it.

-> yum config file /etc/yum.conf

-> repository files are stored under /etc/yum.repos.d

-> creating a repository

#cd /etc/yum.repos.d

#vim first.repo

[1234]  -> repo id

name=app repo   
baseurl= file:///rpms/AppStream/Packages
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

:wq!


#yum clean all    ---> to clean all junk files.

#yum repolist   --> to list all available repositories.

#yum repolist all  --> to list all the repos with its state.

#yum install <pkg name>   --> to install a pkg

#yum update <pkg name>  --> to update a pkg using yum.

#yum remove <pkg name>   --> to uninstall a pkg
