
importing and including playbooks
===================================

it is very helpul for managing large number of tasks,if suppose if we create
 some 300 tasks in one playbook it is difficult  to manage or it is difficult to find the errors so 
what we will do here is we will break larger playbooks into small playbooks  and all these small playbooks
 will be maintained by master playbook this can be done with the help of importing or including playbooks


cd /ansible

vim play1.yml

---
- name: test
  hosts: servera.lab.example.com
  tasks:
  - name: creating a user
    user:
      name:  roy
      state: present

wq!


vim play2.yml

---
- name: justplay
  hosts: serverc.lab.example.com
  tasks:
  - name: creating a user
    user:
      name: bishnoy
      state: present


now im going to create a master playbook

vim play3.yml

---
- name: masterplay
  hosts: all
  tasks:
- name: import the playbook
  import_playbook: play1.yml
- name: import the plybook
  import_playbook: play2.yml

importing or including tasks
==================================

vim play1.yml

- name: installing package
  yum:
    name: vsftpd
    state: present

- name: installing the service
  service:
    name: vsftpd
    state: restarted



vim play2.yml

- name: removing the package
  yum:
    name: httpd
    state: absent

vim play3.yml

---
- name: testing
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - import_tasks: play1.yml
  - import_tasks: play2.yml
or 
  - include_tasks: play1.yml
  - include_tasks: play2.yml

 
  
roles
======
  
larger playbooks are split into multiple files
roles are the way to group multiple different task or complex tasks
reuse of playbook code is easy with roles

structure of roles

ithub
tree ithub

defaults---main.yml
|
files
|
handlers----main.yml
|
meta--main.yml
|
tasks---main.yml
|
template
|
test
|
vars---main.yml

trying to create one web page
install the httpd
start and enable the service
cd /var/www/html ---index.html---</h1>welcome to pragathi<h1>
add the service to the firewall
reload the firewall
copy the ip address and paste it in the url



defaults: default variable for the role
file: contains files to copy to destination
handlers: based on notify do something specified
meta: meta data contains complete information about the role including author license,platform and optical role dependencies
tasks: list of tasks to be executed by the role
template: template files to deploy
tests: if u want additional verification of your build
vars: other variables for the role

creating role skeleton
=========================
the ansible-galaxy command line tool is used to manage ansible roles,including the creation of new roles
the ansible-galaxy init is to create the directory structure for a new role

configuration files for roles
===============================
cd /ansible
mkdir /ansible/roles
pwd /ansible
#ansible-galaxy init /ansible/roles/ithub

cd /ansible/roles/ithub

tree ithub

defaults---main.yml
|
files
|
handlers----main.yml
|
meta--main.yml
|
tasks---main.yml
|
template
|
test
|
vars---main.yml

now go to the task directory and inside u have a main.yml file

vim /tasks/main.yml
